## Description

It works just as the command `run` in AHK does, so you can:
- `run FilePath` to open a file by its associated program. There's no need to quote the path even if it has spaces. Slashes in the path can either be forward or backward.
- `run URL` to open a url by the default browser.
- `run *RunAs program` to run a program as administrator.
- â€¦
